# Crowdfunder

Crowdfunder is a simplified clone of Kickstarter originally built over a one-week
period as an assignment for [Bitmaker's](https://www.bitmaker.co) full-stack
web-development course. This was my first experience planning and building the
models and relationships for a Rails application. Crowdfunder is built with
Ruby on Rails and Sorcery for authentication.
